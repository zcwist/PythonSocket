 Today we are discussing #Flattening banknotes project# 
  #Flattening banknotes project# Required output #Flattening module# of #Design Document# 
 #Design Document# include #experimental report# , #Three-dimensional model# , #Demo Presentation# etc
 #Flattening banknotes project# Needed to meet the requirements of #Specifications# , Including 1000mm / s input banknote #speed# , 300W of #Average power# , One ten thousandth #Note card rate# , 5-8mm of #String height variation# 
 The need to include research #Banknote paper# of #Deformation mechanism# And its influencing factors.
 The results of the literature survey, #Banknote paper# The main ingredient is #fiber# Including cotton fiber and hemp fiber, it is a complex #Polymers# .
 Effect of banknotes #Constitutive equation# Factors include #Paper# and #temperature# 
 banknotes #Constitutive equation# Changes mainly for #Modulus# and #Yield point# The change
 In #force# Under the action, if the bill exceeds its deformation #Yield strain# , Then the bill will take place at the same time #Elastically deformable# and #Plastic deformation# 
 According to previous results, #Flattening# Process and #bending# Process is essentially the same, so are the bills happen #Permanent deformation# the process of.
 For different #Degree of curvature# Paper, through the same flattening module, all that happens #String height# The amount of change is substantially the same.
 In order to understand the different banknote #temperature# Under the #Yield strain# The need for different temperatures #Stretching test# Obtain banknotes #Modulus# Follow #temperature# The curve.
 Also consider the bills #Condition# Influence of modulus
 banknote bent substantially different layers of different banknotes occurred #Plastic strain# It is unrecoverable #Permanent strain# 
 Banknotes #String height# Higher #Radius of curvature# The smaller bills #Degree of curvature# The larger
 Experience tells us, bills are the more curved bend that #Loading curvature# The larger the release later banknotes #Degree of curvature# Greater
 That is, the load on the banknotes #Load strain# The larger the banknote #Plastic strain# The larger
 #Stretching test# You can get the bills #Yield strain# , #Modulus# 
 The need for #Flexural plastic deformation test# Learn different #temperature# under, #Load strain# and #Release strain# The relationship between
 and #Plastic bending test# and #Stretching test# Data obtained alignment
 Currently at room temperature, the bill through #Radius of curvature# It is of 2mm #Curved track# Required to achieve #Flattening effect# 
 In fact required #Curved track# of #Radius of curvature# It must be greater than 8mm, otherwise banknotes #Note card rate# And structure #Wear rate# We will not be accepted.
 At the same time have tested copper #Contact heating# Method, the need to be heated to 160 ℃ #temperature# In order to achieve the required #Flattening effect# , Copper #Radius of curvature# To 25mm
 Tongbang #Contact heating# Cos #Warm-up time# Too long, #temperature# Too, can not be applied in the product.
 to sum up After the need to complete #banknote# of #Stretching test# , #Bending plastic deformation experiment# , While understanding feasible #heating# Methods to achieve rapid heating.
 has now completed #Stretching test# , #Bending plastic deformation experiment# , #Experimental data# Has been submitted to the cloud above the disk, the data being processed has been some preliminary results
  #Curvature# It can be used to measure the banknote #Degree of curvature# , Than #Radius of curvature# , #String height# Better metrics
 #Radius of curvature# and #Curvature# A reciprocal relationship, #Curvature# It corresponds well to the #strain# , Both substantially linear.
 #Stretching test# Obtained at different temperatures of banknotes #Modulus# and #Yield strain# 
 #Bending plastic deformation experiment# Notes in particular given #temperature# and #Load strain# Under the #Release strain# 
 The results of both can be corroborated each other, and with the previous two pre-test results supporting each other
 In order to meet the requirements of #Flattening effect# , While meeting #Curved track# of #Radius of curvature# The minimum limit of 8mm is required to heat the banknote #temperature# To 70 ℃
