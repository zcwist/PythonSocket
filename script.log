Today letâ€™s discuss about #bill note flattening project#
#bill note flattening project# is going to output the #design Documents# of #flattening module#
the #design Documents# contain # lab report#,#3D model# and #Presentation Slides#
The #flattening module# has to meet some #technical specifications# like #note speed# >= 1000 mm/s, #mean power# <=300W, #failure rate#<=10^-4 and so on.
mechanism of note #deformation# and relevant factors need to be investigated.
Many researchers point out that the principal constituent of #bill note# is #fibre# which mainly includes #cotton fibre# and #jute fibre#. These fibres are complicated polymer material.
