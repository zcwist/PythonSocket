Today let’s discuss about #bill note flattening project#
#bill note flattening project# is going to output the #design Documents# of #flattening module#
the #design Documents# contain # lab report#,#3D model# and #Presentation Slides#
#bill note flattening project# has to meet some #technical specifications# like #note speed# >= 1000 mm/s, #mean power# <=300W, #failure rate#<=10^-4 and so on.
#mechanism of note deformation# and relevant factors need to be investigated.
Many researchers point out that the principal constituent of #bill note# is #fibre# which mainly includes #cotton fibre# and #jute fibre#. These fibres are complicated polymer material.
#paper characteristics# and #temperature# are two factors that have impacts on #bill note constitutive equations#.
The variation of #bill note constitutive equations# can be identified primarily by the variation of #modulus# and #yield point#.
Under the action of force, if the deformation of bill note surpasses its own #yield strain#, bill note’s deformation will contain both elastic and plastic parts.
Based on the results of formal experiments, the process of #flattening# and #bending# are virtually identical with each. And they are both a process aiming to bring out #permanent deformation#.
The #variation of chord height # are nearly identical while bill notes with different origin #degree of curvature# pass the same one flattening module.
In order to investigate the relationship between #temperature# and #yield strain# of notes, to conduct #tensile tests# of bill notes at various temperatures is needed, from which curve of relation of modulus and temperature can also be implied.
The bigger the #chord height# is, the smaller the #radius of curvature# is, and the bigger the #curvature# is.
Experiences tell us, notes will have bigger residual #curvature# while it is #bent# more intensively.
That is, the bigger the #load strain# is, the bigger the #plastic strain# is.
We need to conduct an #bending plastic deform test# to study the relation between #plastic strain# and # load strain#
